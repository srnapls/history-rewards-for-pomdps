\section*{Set Theory}
Let $S$ be any countable set, then $|S|$ denotes the cardinality. We let $S^*$ and $S^\omega$ denote the set of finite and infinite sequences over $S$, respectively. For a sequence $\pi\in S^*$ we can denote the length by $|\pi|$.

Let $\epsilon\in S^*$ be the sequence of length zero, so $|\epsilon|= 0$.

\towrite{sequence with set length k will be denoted by $S^k$, of which an element can be rewritten to $s_1s_2\dots s_k$}


\section*{Probability Theory}
For any countable set $S$ we can define a \textit{discrete probability distribution} as $\psi: S\to[0,1]$ where $\sum_{s\in S} \psi(s)=1$. The set of all possible probability distributions over $S$ is denoted as $\Pi(S)$. We denote the support of a \textit{probability distribution} as $supp(\psi)=\{s\in S\mid \psi(s)>0\}$.\\

\towrite{random variable, expected value}
%- expected value of a discrete random variable E[X]
