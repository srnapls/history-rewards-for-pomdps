\section*{Set Theory}
Let $S$ be any countable set, then $|S|$ denotes the cardinality. We let $S^*$ and $S^\omega$ denote the set of finite and infinite sequences over $S$, respectively. For a sequence $\pi\in S^*$ we can denote the length by $|\pi|$.


\section*{Probability Theory}
For any countable set $S$ we can define a \textit{discrete probability distribution} as $\psi: S\to[0,1]$ where $\sum_{s\in S} \psi(s)=1$. The set of all possible probability distributions over $S$ is denoted as $\Pi(S)$. We denote the support of a \textit{probability distribution} as $supp(\psi)=\{s\in S\mid \psi(s)>0\}$.\\
