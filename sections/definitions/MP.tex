A machine is not always defined deterministically. Instead, a process can transition from one state to another by a given probability. In this section we will take a look at some discrete-time stochastic processes, but only those who adhere to the Markov property. 

\begin{definition}[Markov property]
For any $s_0, s_1, \dots, s_{n-1}, s_n \in S$ :
\[P(X_n = s_n \mid X_0=s_0, X_1=s_1,\dots, X_{n-1}=s_{n-1}) = P(X_n =s_n | X_{n-1} = s_{n-1}\]
\label{d:markov}
\end{definition}

This property states that the probability distribution of $X_n$ is only dependent on its immediate past, namely $X_{n-1}$. So for any stochastic process, given the current state we know that the future state is not dependent on the past states.

Note that in the entirety of this thesis, we will only be discudding discrete-time Markov processes. 

\subsection{Markov chain}

Given a simple stochastic process, that conforms to the Markov property as seen in \defref{d:markov} is called a Markov chain. This is simply a set of events, which are connected by some given probabilities.
\begin{definition}[MC]
A Markov chain consists of a set of states $S$, and initial state $s_I\in S$ and a probabilistic transition function $T:S\to\Pi(S)$. 
\end{definition}
Note that $P$ ,the probabilistic transition function, can also be represented as a matrix. 
\subsubsection*{Example}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=3cm,on grid,auto,shorten >=1pt]
			\node[state] (0) 		{$s_0$};
			\node[state] (1) [right=of 0]		{$s_1$};
			\path[->] 	(0) edge [bend left] 	node [above] {$0.4$}	(1)
							edge [loop above]   node [above] {$0.6$}	(0)
						(1) edge [loop above] 	node [above] {$0.2$}	(1)
							edge [bend left]   node [above] {$0.8$}	(0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{A simple Markov chain}
\end{figure}
The transition matrix for this Markov chain is $\begin{pmatrix}
0.6 & 0.4 \\
0.8 & 0.2 
\end{pmatrix}$.
