In \href{https://gitlab.science.ru.nl/srietbergen/thesis/-/blob/master/code/reward_controller_seq.py}{\texttt{code/reward\textunderscore controller\textunderscore seq.py}} we have the following:\\

\texttt{reward\textunderscore controller\textunderscore from\textunderscore sequences(sequences,omega)}\\
Given a dictionary in the shape of $\{\texttt{seq}_1 : r_1,\:\texttt{seq}_2 : r_2,\dots,\: \texttt{seq}_n : r_n\}$ together with the set $\Omega$ representing the input alphabet, it will return a reward controller as described in \algorithmref{procedure:into_reward_controller}.
